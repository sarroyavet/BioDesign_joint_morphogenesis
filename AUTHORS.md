This project was developed at Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, ISM, Marseille, France. , and was supported by French Research National Agency (ANR) Grant No. ANR-20-CE10-0008.

This repository contains the implementation of a bio-inspired algorithm for the design of unilateral contact surfaces based on the morphogenesis of synovial joint principles. It is meant to be used with  [CODE_ASTER 14.4](https://code-aster.org/), [GMSH 4.9.3](https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html), and [Paraview 5.9](https://www.paraview.org/) (for result visualization).
